# MSDS 7331 Machine Learning 1

## Introduction
The purpose of this repository is to share our collaborative work in order to complete our MSDS 7331 Machine Learning work. We worked collaboratively as a team all semester to complete the: labs, in class assignments, and extra credit assignment. This work was completed in ipynb documents using jupyter notebook/lab.
