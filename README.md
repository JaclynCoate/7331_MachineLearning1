# MSDS 7331 Machine Learning 1

## Introduction
The purpose of this repository is to share our collaborative work in order to complete our MSDS 7331 Machine Learning work. We worked collaboratively as a team all semester to complete the: labs, live session assignments, and extra credit assignment. This work was completed in ipynb documents using jupyter notebook/lab. 

## Github Case Study Structure
* [Labs] - 4 assignments give in the semester to evaluate a single data set chosen in the first week of class
* [Live Session Assignments] - 5 in class assignments where we worked to answer questions about certain Python features being taught that unit
* [Extra Credit] - an assignment in predicting COVID new cases in Texas
